## Styleguide

> Note: The Styleguide is currently broken as we can't use the webpack config from nuxt.js at the moment. If you find a way to fix that issue, please feel free to open a pull-request

The Developer Style Guide provides important infos about components and styles. To start it simply type:

```bash
$ npm run styleguide
```

When built you can open it at [http://localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060)

## Backpack

We use [backpack](https://github.com/palmerhq/backpack) to watch and build the application, so you can use the latest ES6 features \(module syntax, async/await, etc.\).
