# Human-Connection WebApp
> uses the Nuxt.js and Express.js projects

> **Note:** This is only the WebApp part of Human-Connection, you have to also checkout the [API](https://github.com/Human-Connection/API) which is used by this WebApp.

This is the nuxt + express version of our WebApp as nuxt.js seams to be more stable and we have better options for keeping it updated.
