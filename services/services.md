# Services

The Human Connection Plattform consists of seperate services that can be split into seperate parts in a micoservice approach.

> **Note: **When we split the services apart we have to make sure that the realtime events will be triggered correctly. 
>
> It's also not done in the first step as we wanted to be able to build and deliver quickly with a really small team which fluctuate very strongly.
