### Introduction
You want to contribute to the Human-Connection project? Great! Just read
on!</br>
You're still undecided how you could actually help? We've got you
covered!</br>
</br>
Head over to Opensource.Guide - there's an article that tells a lot
about the Why and
[How to contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).</br>
</br>

### Components Overview
Human-Connection is build on its two main components: the server API and
the Web-App.</br>
Both are developed in separate repositories and can be run either
locally or off a docker image.</br>
Also the documentation is in its own repository.</br>
</br>
### Get the code
#### Clone the repositories
To explore and make changes to the files in the repository, you may want
to clone it to your local disk.</br>
</br>
You'll find them here on GitHub:</br>
[Server API](https://github.com/Human-Connection/API)</br>
[Web App](https://github.com/Human-Connection/WebApp)</br>
[Documentation](https://github.com/Human-Connection/Documentation)</br>
</br>
### Change the code
#### Fork the code
To change the code, you can fork the repository that you want to change
files in into your own GitHub.</br>
</br>
After that you are able to clone this forked repository to your local
system as well and begin to make changes in it.</br>
Add, fix, change the code as you wish. To make it easier for everyone
maintaining or reviewing your code, you are encouraged to stick to the
[coding guidelines]().</br>
</br>
Also, feel free to commit your changes as often as you like. There is no
commit limit.
</br>
### Test the code
To test your changes, you will need to setup the API and the Web App
environments.</br>
#### Setup Developer Environment
There is a docker and a local setup available for both parts - and you
are free to choose whatever you like - we would recommend the docker
images for an easy start, though:</br>

[Setup the API via docker](https://docs.human-connection.org/server-api/installation.html#installation-via-docker)</br>
[Setup the API locally](https://docs.human-connection.org/server-api/installation.html#installation-on-local-system)</br>
[Setup the Web App via docker](https://docs.human-connection.org/web-app/installation.html#installation-via-docker)</br>
[Setup the Web App locally](https://docs.human-connection.org/web-app/installation.html#installation-on-local-system)</br>
